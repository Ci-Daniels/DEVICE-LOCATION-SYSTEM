# DEVICE-LOCATION-SYSTEM
It has if not all the time, most times happened that we lose or misplace our keys or wallets; and the experience has been traumatic. Having to go back and try to trace back our steps. Sometimes with luck, we find the lost item but other times, we end up having to replace them.  The alert system helps solve this problem quickly. This is by automating the entire process of locating the lost items. It allows us to turn on a buzzer through the click of a button in our phones which in turn gives the location of the item.

## SPECIFICATIONS
 ### ESP 8266 NODEMCU
   -2.4 GHz Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n, supporting WPA/WPA2).
   -General-purpose input/output (16 GPIO).
   -Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C) serial communication protocol.
   -Analog-to-digital conversion (10-bit ADC).
   -Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) serial communication protocol.
   -I²S (Inter-IC Sound) interfaces with DMA(Direct Memory Access) (sharing pins with GPIO).
   -UART (on dedicated pins, plus a transmit-only UART can be enabled on GPIO2).
   -Pulse-width modulation (PWM).
   -It employs a 32-bit RISC CPU (reduced instruction set computer) based on the Tensilica Xtensa L106 running at 80 MHz (or overclocked to 160 MHz).
   -It has a 64 KB boot ROM, 64 KB instruction RAM, and 96 KB data RAM. External flash memory can be accessed through SPI.
